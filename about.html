            <h3>Our Origins</h3>
            <p>
                DoreanByte was founded by two close friends with the aim of developing intuitive, practical and straightforward
                software and hardware solutions. Predominantly a technology company, we saw that Malawi has a massive untapped
                potential as the next market for a digital business hub. DoreanByte aims to take advantage of this opportunity and create
                software ecosystems to cater to Malawi’s growing population and diverse needs.

            <h3>Our Skills</h3>
            <p>
                Leveraging a diverse set of skills and expertise, DoreanByte aims to create solutions that tackle unique challenges
                present in society. All while creating an enjoyable and practical experience. DoreanByte also takes a stance on
                delivering, quality feature rich software. This is because we are passionate about providing our society with
                helpful
                solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have a particular knack for finding good solutions, we notice areas that are lacking in terms of useful
                technological
                services. We then work on conceptualizing and implementing solutions in the best way possible. We take great pride
                in
                our promise to quality, its safe to say we only associate the DoreanByte name with our finest work.

            <h3>Our Goals and Aims</h3>
            <p>
                We are still young and though we are in our early stages of development, we have already proudly worked with Way
                Ministries. Designing and developing their website to help spread their message of teaching the next generation of
                Malawian leaders and thinkers.

            </a>
            <p>
                With more projects to come. Apart from client fulfillment, we are also self-starting with our own projects that we are proud of as well.
                One of these is Katswiri, a job listing aggregator that helps pull content from various job listing providers and
                brings it all together in an intuitive and easy to use interface. This was done out of the passion of wanting to help job
                seekers and others in making it easier to find employment opportunities while reducing the mental overhead of having
                to
                search multiple job listing sources.

            <h3>Our Moto</h3>
            <p>
                Our trait of not waiting for the solutions to problems from others in regards to the difficulties we notice in
                society
                by implementing our own answers is what makes us have an edge that we are proud of. We know our skill-sets and
                through
                DoreanByte we know we can achieve so much more. Malawi is growing, home to multiple industries and at the same time
                multiple problems. Where some see hopelessness we see opportunity, opportunity to impact people’s lives and go
                beyond by
                changing how we approach business, finance, health, productivity and so much more.
            </p>
